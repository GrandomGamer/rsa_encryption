# rsa_encryption
COP1500 Integration Project
Designed by: Alex Trepasso

The overall goal of this project is to make a visual and interactive use of the RSA algorithm for cryptology.
The program can take in or generate its own prime numbers based on what the user decides and then uses those primes to not only
encrypt but also decrypt any input that the user enters.
